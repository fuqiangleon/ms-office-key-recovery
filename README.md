Microsoft Office Product Key Recovery
=====================================

Extracts Microsoft Office Key from the registry file.  This is a cross-platform version of the [msoffice-product-key-decoder](https://code.google.com/p/msoffice-product-key-decoder) which has been adapted to use a cross-platform registry reading library rather than the Windows only library used by the original.

Pass the file path to the Windows software registry file as the sole parameter.  The software registry file is typically located at c:\Windows\system32\config\software

For Office 2010, if the original install disks are not available, a valid Office 2010 License key can be used to obtain the install software via the [Office 2010 Backup Download](https://www20.downloadoffice2010.microsoft.com/usa/registerkey.aspx?ref=backup&country_id=US&culture=EN-US).
